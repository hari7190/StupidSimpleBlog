# Stupid Simple Blog

Can I do with any of the countless blogging platforms? Yes.

Is it doing something more than others do? Probably not.

Why am I writing this then? Because I like to.


## Motivation

I was looking for a flat file blogging platform like Ghost to setup my
new blog in. I switch hosting providers very often (why? See above points).
And I wanted to be able to do without lugging around a database. So this repository took birth.


## Code

Python
