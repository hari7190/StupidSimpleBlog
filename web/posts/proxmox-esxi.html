    <h3>Proxmox or ESXI</h3>

    <p>
        Selecting a baremetal virtualization solution for my home lab. TL;DR I now have both !

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        I run a few servers at home which I mostly use for experimenting with new tech, home automation 
        and as media servers. The problem is I run older enterprise hardware like Dell Poweredge R710 and the likes. And the newer 
        ESXIs are not supported on them.

    <h5>And then...</h5>
    <p>
        I love open source and prefer to work on opensource technologies even at work if I have the say. But when it comes to 
        enterprise IT, I want the same softwares what we use at my work. Even though having fun is the main criteria for the homelab
        it should help me learn things I can use at work too. At least that is what I tell my wife to justify the stuff I buy &#128521;.
