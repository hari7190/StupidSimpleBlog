    <h3>My struggle for a message broker</h3>

    <p>
        Searching for the perfect open source message broker for my usecase
    </p>

    <h4>Use Case</h4>

    <p>
        I am now working on a new implementation for a better distributed asynchronous application. Our current application
        suite contains a application we use for these offline tasks. A typical tasks will be like processing the result
        set of around 100,000 users and creating certain action items for them depending on the activity and data for that user.
        It can involve analysis, producing notifications or a database CRUD operation.
    </p>

    <h4>Main Candidates</h4>

    <p>
        Main candidates are Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ.
