<p>I have a couple of Proxmox servers which I use to host Kubernetes nodes. I keep them at the basement because I do not want to deal with the noise. But there are no wired connections available.</p>

<p>I am not buying an extender and be done with it.</p>

<h6 id="attempt-1">Attempt #1</h6>
<p>I have a TP-Link Dual Band WiFi router lying around. It does have WDS feature and can act as a repeater. 💡 Idea !</p>
<p>Jumped across the room and appreciated myself. Then went ahead and did the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled DHCP - IP assignment will be handled by the main router.</li>
<li>Changed the IP address from 192.168.0.1 to something else. - It is no longer the gateway.</li>
<li>Enabled WDS bridging</li>
<li>Surveyed the WiFi AP I want to access and gave credentials.</li>
<li>Changed the Channel to the same channel as original network is at.</li>
<li>Disabled SSID broadcast - Not necessary.</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugged in patch cables from both servers and turned on. Well, I now have internet for those machines.</p>
<p>Days went by and I was happy. Suddenly one day the router started dropping connections and I am no longer happy. Sometimes my machines were not reachable for days. It used to recover by itself in a couple hours or immediately with a reboot.</p>
<p>It happened again and this time even multiple reboots did not work. So I moved on to next attempt.</p>

<p>I purchased two types of WiFi USB adapters. One rated at 1200 MBPS and other one at 600 MBPS. Not great but will work fine for my use case.</p>
<p>Chinese made, and have great reviews right off of Amazon. Problem is there are no drivers available for this. Actually there is no information on what chip set is used. Included drivers work fine for Windows. I'm not sure if MacOS drivers works the same but, I believe it does.</p>
<p>Connected the USB devices one by one and did  <em>lsusb</em> which outputs this:</p>

<p>I found an answer from Ask Ubuntu (linked below) where there is a Github repository who adopted the driver code for Ubuntu 19.10. Follow the following steps to install.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install git dkms
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git
cd rtl8812au
sudo ./dkms-install.sh
sudo modprobe 88XXau

<p>There might be a few issues you might face if you are trying to do in Proxmox.</p>

<p>To fix this, we need to install the missing libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add /src/apt/sources.list with the below repo.
<pre><code class="language-bash"># PVE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pve-no-subscription
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Update the indices
<pre><code class="language-bash">apt update
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Install headers
<pre><code class="language-bash">apt install pve-headers-$(uname -r)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Done ! We have the headers now.</p>
