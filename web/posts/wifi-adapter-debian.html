<h5 id="problem">Problem</h5>
<p>I have a couple of Proxmox servers which I use to host Kubernetes nodes. I keep them at the basement because I do not want to deal with the noise. But there are no wired connections available.</p>
<h5 id="rules">Rules</h5>
<p>I am not buying an extender and be done with it.</p>
<h5 id="solution">Solution</h5>
<h6 id="attempt-1">Attempt #1</h6>
<p>I have a TP-Link Dual Band WiFi router lying around. It does have WDS feature and can act as a repeater. 💡 Idea !</p>
<p>Jumped across the room and appreciated myself. Then went ahead and did the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled DHCP - IP assignment will be handled by the main router.</li>
<li>Changed the IP address from 192.168.0.1 to something else. - It is no longer the gateway.</li>
<li>Enabled WDS bridging</li>
<li>Surveyed the WiFi AP I want to access and gave credentials.</li>
<li>Changed the Channel to the same channel as original network is at.</li>
<li>Disabled SSID broadcast - Not necessary.</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugged in patch cables from both servers and turned on. Well, I now have internet for those machines.</p>
<p>Days went by and I was happy. Suddenly one day the router started dropping connections and I am no longer happy. Sometimes my machines were not reachable for days. It used to recover by itself in a couple hours or immediately with a reboot.</p>
<p>It happened again and this time even multiple reboots did not work. So I moved on to next attempt.</p>
<h6 id="attempt-2">Attempt #2</h6>
<p>I purchased two types of WiFi USB adapters. One rated at 1200 MBPS and other one at 600 MBPS. Not great but will work fine for my use case.</p>
<p>Chinese made, and have great reviews right off of Amazon. Problem is there are no drivers available for this. Actually there is no information on what chip set is used. Included drivers work fine for Windows. I'm not sure if MacOS drivers works the same but, I believe it does.</p>
<p>Connected the USB devices one by one and did  <em>lsusb</em> which outputs this:</p>

<hr />
<p>If you my goal was to get a typical Ubuntu box, I would be done by now. But, we need a Linux Bridge for Proxmox machine which can enslave the new wifi module. And then we connect that bridge to all the VM NICs</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, I realized that it cannot be done or I don't understand it enough to do that. That is when I came across this post from super helpful folks at Proxmox - <a href="https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/using-wifi-instead-of-ethernet.56691/">link</a>. The issue mentioned here is not exactly what my problem is  but it gave me a framework to work with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As per, Stoiko Ivanov, Proxmox Staff Member:</p>
<p>AFAIR wifi-interfaces usually do not support being part of a bridge in station (client) mode (i.e. you can only add them in access-point mode).</p>
<p>What should work is using a NAT/routed config - see <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/ch..._nat_with_span_class_monospaced_iptables_span">https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/ch..._nat_with_span_class_monospaced_iptables_span</a></p>
<p>just take the wlo1 as interface holding the default route, add a vmbr0 without any physical ports, configure ip-forwarding and optionally add NAT rules.</p>
<p>hope this helps!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="alright-the-new-plan">Alright the new plan!</h4>
<p>We are not going to enslave the WiFi adapter and instead we will create a Linux Bridge without any physical ports and setup up default gateway only on the WiFi interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HA! That worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the final configuration looks like this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">root@pve:~# cat /etc/network/interfaces

<p>I am now able to reach to internet and other local network from Proxmox (Debian) shell.</p>
<p>Data transfer rates with WiFi adapters (rated at 600 Mbps to 1200 Mbps but only giving 45 mbps) were disappointing at best, but it works for my use case.</p>
<p>I ran some tests using iPerf3 - Look here for instructions.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps:</h3>
<p>Now I have Proxmox servers with WiFi connectivity, but I still  have to figure out the internal network for the VMs.
There are still many many concerns to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the routing happens</li>
<li>speed</li>
<li>DHCP assignments</li>
<li>How do I get into that box - VPN or bridge</li>
<li>iDrac have an Ethernet port and I need to find a way to get that online too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got my Archer C7 upgraded to the latest firmware and it seems to be working fine now. So now I'm back to using wired connections for most of the things and WIFI is like a back up if Archer C7 starts dropping connections.</li>
<li>Get Linux ready WiFi adapters and see how the speeds improve.</li>
<li>Learn more about Linux networking and Proxmox to figure out the vlan setup with the bridge and might use Vyos as a virtualized internal network router.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="references">References</h5>
<p>I have used so many resources while I was trying to figure it out. Some of them are linked below.</p>
